House Price Prediction
This is one of the most basic machine learning projects you will come across while looking for scikit-learn projects. Use the Boston dataset from Kaggle, which will help predict the prices of houses in the Boston area. You can use the StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to scale or normalize the data in this project. You can easily apply linear regression to your dataset using the LinearRegression method. Use the Mean Square Error (MSE) and R2 score to evaluate how well your model is performing. Alternatively, you can resolve this regression issue with a multi-layer perceptron. Use the MLPRegressor method from the sklearn library to achieve this.

## Steps to complete: 
1. Import Boston dataset from kaggle
2. Use Standardscaler or MinMaxScaler to scale/normalize the data
3. Apply linear regression
4. Evaluate perfomance
5. Apply multi-layer perception (MLPRegressor)

## Ideas for after project: 
* Build a simple interfact where you can add in an address and it returns the housing price
* Change the boston data set with the detroit data set
